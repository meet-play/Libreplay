00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.780
The following fan film has been produced
by amateurs and was financed privately.

2
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.440
For comparison:

3
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.100
One episode of ST:TNG in season 7 had
a budget of about 1.7mio US dollars.

4
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.100
The money was used to pay professional actors,
special effects, settings, equipment and much more.

6
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.720
Oh dear, you really use every
opportunity, don't you?

7
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.900
And you are just accidently within eyeshot?

8
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.260
I checked the program. The water
is at 28 C - so brave.

9
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.640
Michael, there is work to do!

10
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.900
We'll be right there!

11
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.080
He almost steals your show.

12
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.680
Thanks a lot, KITT!

13
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.520
Michael, I hope you do not believe I
let you onto my seats, as soppy as you are?

14
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.460
I'm glad our shuttles are not that picky.

15
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.140
Computer, civil clothes of the
80ies of the 20th century.

16
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.020
As usual, your clothes are
in the trunk, Michael.

17
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.120
Dog, back off! Let me be!

18
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.880
You leave me no choice.

19
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.340
And this is supposed to
be man's best friend.

20
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.640
Suits you.

21
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.780
The Foundation for Law and Government
gave us new orders, Bonnie.

22
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.880
Bonnie?!

23
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.020
I am Michael Knight and you are
Dr. Bonnie Barstow, we are saving the world.

24
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.940
I don't think dressing up and reenacting
old TV series is my cup of tea.

25
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.440
And according to my history lessons
there weren't any talking cars

26
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.440
in the 20th century.

27
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.500
KITT, would you please introduce yourself.

28
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.220
I am KITT, the voice of Knight
Industry 2000's Micro processor,

29
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.640
K.I.T.T. for easy reference.
KITT, if you prefer.

30
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.060
No, I don't prefer.

31
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.060
Knight Rider – A shadowy flight
into the dangerous world

32
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.720
of a man who does not exist.

33
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.200
Where are your curls, Michael?

34
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.900
Analyse, KITT.

35
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.580
That is beyond my abilities, Michael.

36
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.760
I don't think this is part of the program.

37
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.580
Computer, end program.

38
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.280
Michael, may I point out one should
never quit a holo program while sitting?

39
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.480
Oh, shut up, KITT.

40
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.100
He's right, though...

41
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.480
Computer, exit.

42
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.340
We just dropped out of warp.

43
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.840
What's the problem?

44
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.880
We were hit by some kind of shock wave.

45
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.000
Origin?

46
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.520
I'm checking it.

47
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.940
Wait, we just lost all sensor data.

48
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.840
The computer is displaying some
kind of message but I don't have access.

49
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.340
Take a look.

50
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.380
I can see it here.

51
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.080
What is it?

52
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.860
I have no idea. My command codes are
not working. According to the computer,

53
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.600
I am not authorized to see the message.
We cannot work like that.

54
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.180
Remar, find the source!

55
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.620
Do not do anything, I will handle that.

56
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:29.100
Mr. Graydon, send all sensor data to my room
and contact New Hope via Channel Gold.

57
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.040
Silverworld, shut down engines
and hold this position.

58
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.680
Commander, what's going on here?

59
00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:36.279
I can not explain this to you right now.
Do not inform the rest of the crew.

60
00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.879
You will receive further instructions, soon.

61
00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.699
Computer, lock the doors to this room,
no access without my permission.

62
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.840
The doors are locked.

63
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.520
Access secret file Omega 1.

64
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.360
Voice print confirmed.
State the access code.

65
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.460
Gamma 1492, authorization level 10.

66
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.700
Affirmative.

67
00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.900
Sensors have detected the omega phenomenon
within a distance of 1.25 light years.

68
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:07.720
Execute the Omega directive immediately.
All other priorities are cancelled.

69
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.860
Display sensor data.

70
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.540
Space: the final frontier.

71
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.920
We are in a parallel universe.

72
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.820
These are the voyages of the
Union's starship K’Ehleyr.

73
00:09:51.040 --> 00:10:00.320
Its mission: to defend the peoples
of the Union, to protect their freedom

74
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.380
and to explore the depths of space.

75
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.140
The K'Ehleyr's crew boldly carries out

76
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:12.060
its duties to emerge glorious
from every battle!

77
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.740
You know about the directive.
Do what is neccessary.

78
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.160
I hereby request permission to
let a part of the crew in on this.

79
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.420
Under the given circumstances, I see no
option to execute the directive on my own.

80
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.080
You know the resonsibility
this entails.

81
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.440
Tell the executive officers and
those you trust, nobody else.

82
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.280
Personal logs about this mission are prohibited.

83
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.540
I order radio silence to all
other vessels of the squadron.

84
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.460
I understand, Admiral.

85
00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.460
What's up with this?
What are we waiting for?

86
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.060
The computers are still blocked.

87
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.240
Keep calm. There surely is
an explanation for all that.

88
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.080
Sensors are still working and recording
data. I just cannot access them.

89
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.920
The holo deck is going haywire,
what is going on?

90
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.760
It's not just the holo deck.
All computers display this symbol.

91
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.980
You are engineers. Repair it already!

92
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.160
It doesn't look like a malfunction, Sorel.

93
00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.640
I'll say it again...

94
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.240
This is Commander Logan.
All executive officers are to come

95
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.540
to the conference room immediately.
Logan Out.

96
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.280
You heard it.
Ensign Jones, you have the bridge.

97
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.900
Remain on standby, there will be answers, soon.

98
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.080
For the executive officers, at least.

99
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.300
Pha!

100
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.020
The information I give you now is subject
to security level 10 and restricted

101
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.820
to captains of Starfleet. The breach of this
rule is coordinated with Admiral Ceemex.

102
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.860
What is the matter, Logan?

103
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.140
Mr. Remar, I transferred the sensor data,
please take a look.

104
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.140
A black hole, Sir?

105
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.980
This will complicate our task
but it is not what we are here for.

106
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.160
If the security protocols of Starfleet
are working correctly nobody of you

107
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.160
knows about the Omega Directive.

108
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.560
In the resistence there were rumors
about a highly effective weapon

109
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.060
developed by the Union using a rare element.

110
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.080
No weapon, but research was done.
I will give you but a short introduction.

111
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.120
We are stuck in an unknown region of the
universe, the sensors are not accessible

112
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.740
and our executive officers
are taking a coffee break?

113
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.320
Should someone attacks us in this moment
it will not be my responsibility.

114
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.340
The computer would surely warn us,
should such thing happen.

115
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.920
Well, you put a lot of trust in a machine
that is currently refusing to work.

116
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.900
Guys, we are members of Starfleet
and should act accordingly!

117
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.260
This whining is unbearable.

118
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.360
Do you propose an alternative, Ensign?

119
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.100
The Commander will surely give
an explanation in due time.

120
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.320
An enormous energy source
which could affect the subspace

121
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.520
and destroy all life within one sector.

122
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.160
And exactly these Omega molecules are
now drifting on the edge of the black hole.

123
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.880
Sounds fun!

124
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.740
What do we tell the crew?

125
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.820
Nothing. I did expand
the Directive, not revoke it.

126
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.820
They are all members of
Starfleet, they will understand.

127
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.480
While being underway we
have to modify the vessle.

128
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.200
You have your orders.

129
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:55.580
We need a plan to handle the black
hole and neutralize the molecules.

130
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.500
Start as soon as you are back on the brigde.

131
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.200
Questions? Dismissed.

132
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.060
Your shift is over. Go to your
quarters and wait for new orders.

133
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.300
There will be a new schedule, shortly.

134
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.000
I want to know what's going on here!

135
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.400
Stop making a drama of it. Come on!

136
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.600
He is right.
When will we learn more, Commander?

137
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.380
It is not allowed...

138
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.000
When we have more information, Mr. Phenix.
At present, we are collecting data, too.

139
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.340
Come on, enjoy your free time.

140
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:51.160
Computer, unblock bridge controls,
access code Omega 93red.

141
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.420
Affirmative. Bridge controls unblocked.

142
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.660
Mr. Remar, you know our destination,
maximum warp, energize.

143
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:07.020
This is Commander Logan. Due to the
top security level Omega Directive

144
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.140
there will be changes in the schedule
within the next hours.

145
00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.100
They are to guarantee an efficient
execution of the upcoming mission.

146
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:20.540
Follow the orders you will be given.
We will act according to the Union's priorities

147
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.540
until they are replaced by the Omega Directive. Logan Out.

148
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.240
You did a really good job.

149
00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.700
For 2 years we were transferring components.

150
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.280
The station just waits for you
to take it into operation, Captain.

151
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.900
If this works, the victory of
the rebellion will be within reach.

152
00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.580
Vulcan will be safe and strong
in this new Terran Empire.

153
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.800
But this time, we will refrain
from suppressing non-humans.

154
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.480
Especially Bajorans.

155
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.960
There are indications that in this universe,
great and robust empires exist, too.

156
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.360
It would be a significant gain
of knowledge to question locals.

157
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.840
As far as we know there is a
high concentration of Omega molecules.

158
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.260
The planet orbits the black hole
with 90% of the speed of light.

159
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.540
How is that even possible?

160
00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.020
The planet is already quite close
to the centre of the black hole.

161
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.700
We have to find a way to counteract
the temporal distortion in this area.

162
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.920
Using the warp engine we should
definitely be able to escape the black hole.

163
00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.280
Well, I'm not that eager to fly
there and find out afterwards

164
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.280
that all people we knew outside
this vessle have been dead for 300 years.

165
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.000
Precisely.

166
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.880
Chenara, T'Olverine, work out
a plan to modify our shields.

167
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:49.920
I recall a report of the USS Voyager
about an experiment with temporal shields.

168
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.400
I'll take a look at the data base.

169
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.520
How can the planet defy these
enormous gravitational forces?

170
00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:02.000
Maybe there is some kind of
artificial warp field

171
00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:06.760
rectifying the planets local space time.

172
00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.300
Artificial?

173
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.240
Anyway, we should be careful:
A black hole, Omega molecules,

174
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.740
a mysterious planet, that's really
a lot for such a little ship.

175
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.200
Logan, we have to explain it to the crew.
If someone notices we are entering

176
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.180
the gravitational field of a black hole,
there will be questions.

177
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.340
The crew has orders to follow. They should
concentrate on their tasks instead of

178
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:36.580
posing questions. It is sufficient that
we as executive officers are briefed.

179
00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.000
You have a strange concept
of democracy, Mr. T'Olverine.

180
00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.380
Under these circumstances, the Omega
Directive overrides democracy.

181
00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.040
Our mission is clear.

182
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.140
This is Commander Logan.

183
00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.680
At present, only executive officers
are allowed to enter the bridge.

184
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.920
>>Those scheduled for bridge service
are on standby.

185
00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.440
Be ready and follow your orders. Logan Out.

186
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.960
Ts, that was truly enlightening.

187
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.540
He can't be serious!

188
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:17.080
Guys, stay calm. Surely,
there will be explanations, soon.

189
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.900
You are trying to calm us while
you are as much in the dark as we are.

190
00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.560
You have been expelled from the brigde, too.

191
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.840
Arguing doesn't help us at all.
Do you want to know what I'm thinking?

192
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.620
No.

193
00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.760
I think there is a type 6 protostar
out there and the Commander aims to

194
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.160
open a worm hole to the
alpha quadrant by detonation.

195
00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.965
Theoretically, this is possible.

196
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.100
Um, a top secret mission
of the science department?

197
00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.400
The Commander babbled something
about an Omega Directive.

198
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.160
I'd really like to know what that is.

199
00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.900
There's nothing in the data base
about that. I took a look,

200
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.720
it's all security level 10.

201
00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.920
Damn, I don't just want to sit and wait.

202
00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.840
Well, lets get this babe started.

203
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.820
There we go. Works in every universe.

204
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.660
Shields are working, systems are booting up.

205
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.100
Everything looks good.

206
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.080
Nice machine, Sheelah.

207
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.960
How far are you with
the Omega collector, T'Jul?

208
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.080
Done in 2 hours.
I need three more engineers.

209
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.060
Right. The team is already
on standby. Get everything ready

210
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.180
up here and wait for our return.

211
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.620
After the Karemma incident 8 months
ago we installed weapon systems

212
00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.900
and an extermination unit.
We are well-prepared.

213
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.800
Tom, may I talk to you for a minute?

214
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.300
You should concentrate on the mission.

215
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.260
Were your 3 'conversations' during
our flight not enough distraction?

216
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.660
If I could distract myself only every 7 years,
I would look as jaundiced as you.

217
00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.240
What's up?

218
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.240
This is the last opportunity to stop it.
There will be no way back afterwards.

219
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.180
We have talked about this several times...

220
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.000
The Klingon-Cardassian alliance is dying, Tom.

221
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.660
I don't know if this weapon is still necessary.

222
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:34.220
For years hundreds of people
worked and died for this.

223
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.580
The Romulans, Gorn and Ferengi turn against us.

224
00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.620
If we want to create the new world
we dream of, we'll need a bargaining chip.

225
00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.200
And if it falls into the wrong hands, like hers?

226
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.480
I will be able to prevent that.

227
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:52.000
But she is the only one to know how to
construct this weapon. I need her, for now.

228
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.600
And for now, she needs you.

229
00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.620
That may change soon.

230
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.360
Take care.

231
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.720
I don't trust her and this Sorel.

232
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.620
I don't trust her either,
but I have enough people I can rely on.

233
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.120
Don't worry.

234
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.460
Don't talk to me like to a little child.
I got your back!

235
00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.220
What..is..that?

236
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.540
That's a black hole.

237
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.700
Hm,  that's all well and good,
but this can't be the reason

238
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.700
for this secretiveness.
It's not a first, right?

239
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.500
I wonder why are we so close?

240
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.560
Who knows? Maybe the Commander wants
to cheer us up with some natural spectacle.

241
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.400
What...?

242
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.860
If we get even closer, we'll have to
assume that the black hole's gravity

243
00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.240
and time dilatation strongly
influence the space-time continuum.

244
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.540
Excuse me?

245
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.700
As per theory of relativity
clocks tick slower while on

246
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.660
relatively faster objects
or near high-mass bodies.

247
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:13.980
Oh, really?

248
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.120
Hey!

249
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.000
That's the basic course of introduction to space
flight, even you should have attended this class.

250
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:24.700
Mr. Sorel, this effect had already been
experimentally proven on 20th century earth.

251
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:30.620
Back then, an aircraft - some antiquated
vehicle of that time - had been equipped

252
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.920
with 4 atomic clocks. Similar atomic
clocks were situated at the starting point

253
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:40.320
of the aircraft. The vehicle surrounded
earth 2 times with a relatively higher velocity.

254
00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:47.620
When back at its origin: Behold!
All clocks aboard the aircraft ran slow.

255
00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.420
If you still think this is nonsense,
I can't help you.

256
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.160
Whatever, that's water under the bridge.

257
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.340
Problem is, time runs much
slower for us the closer we get.

258
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.940
One minute here might be years in some distance.

259
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.600
I'm El-Aurian and saw many decades come and go.

260
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.280
However, I wouldn't be delighted
to fast forward several centuries

261
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.280
and have no clue why.

262
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.720
Come on, we'll find out.

263
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.860
What are you up to?

264
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.080
I don't like being fooled.

265
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.960
And therefore I will modulate
the shields' phase variance

266
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.580
so they can withstand temporal distortions.

267
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.800
I still don't know what keeps up the
subspace barrier and the planet's atmosphere

268
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:42.420
but with the right vaccine a
landing party should be able to beam down.

269
00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.860
The warp engine was reinforced
with multi phase shields,

270
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.660
this will protect it against
effects of subspace radiation.

271
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.060
That sound reassuring,
it means we can get to the planet.

272
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.460
Mr. T'Olverine, did you find
a way to secure the Omega molecules

273
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.460
once we get hold of them?

274
00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.540
Indeed, Sir.
In cargo bay 1, we are installing

275
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.040
a harmonic resonance chamber
to contain the molecule.

276
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.840
What's that supposed to be?

277
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.960
The Commander gave me access to restricted files.

278
00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:17.840
According to research of the
Obsidian Order and physicist Ketteract

279
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.820
this chamber is able to
break the molecules' bonds

280
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.640
and prevent a chain reaction.

281
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.360
And thus also the subspace tears? I like that.

282
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:34.140
Yes, but we'll need a landing party
to tag the molecules and initiate their transport.

283
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.040
The alternative would be
torpedoes with gravimetric charges.

284
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:44.020
They will neutralize Omega but also damage
the subspace within a radius of 10 light years.

285
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.700
In the KAT nobody has sufficient security
clearance. Who do you intend to send?

286
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.560
Nobody here has sufficient clearance, either.

287
00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.660
Mr. Remar, assemble a team, choose people you trust.

288
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.340
The information ban stands.

289
00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.800
Aye Sir, I'll gather my team.

290
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.740
You won't beam down without
getting some Arethrazine from me.

291
00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.280
Shouldn't treatment with Arethrazine
be continuously supervised by a doctor?

292
00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.060
The Omega Directive overrides this protocol.

293
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.120
The Omega collector is prepared
and can begin the storage process.

294
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.960
You ought to be on your way.

295
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.340
I love plans that work out.

296
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.700
Don't celebrate just yet,
there is something on the sensors.

297
00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.620
Did they build this vessle in every universe?
What are they doing here?

298
00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.120
Didn't you say humans did not get
to the gamma quadrant in this universe?

299
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.380
We thought so, yes.

300
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.940
Some unforeseen variance.
You do have a warbird, use it.

301
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.020
We should find out what they want.
You can't leave Omega to them, Tom.

302
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.500
Come on, we stick to the plan
and fly to the planet.

303
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.240
I bet they also want to go there.
I didn't battle my way throught

304
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.320
half of the Romulan Empire
to run from the Defiant now.

305
00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.740
The correct identification of
this ship is USS K'Ehleyr NX-82000.

306
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.580
T'Jul to T'Olverine.

307
00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.900
I am listening.

308
00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.680
The preparations for the transfer are finished.

309
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.840
The chamber is ready, too.

310
00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.420
Can you accelerate the
identification of the particles?

311
00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.880
Affirmative.

312
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.140
Commander! Doctor!

313
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.840
You know I can't tell you anything,
so just don't ask.

314
00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:57.720
We have the right to know what's going on.
You read our minds and know all our secrets.

315
00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.480
And now you expect us to let you dictate
what we are to know and what not?

316
00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:07.060
Outside there's a black hole, we get closer
and closer and nobody tells us what's going on.

317
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.740
Spit it out!

318
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.560
Listen, I don't like this situation any more
than you do, but the Union's highest representatives

319
00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:18.560
decided years ago that this knowledge
is to be passed only to the command section

320
00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:23.560
of Starfleet. Who am I to defy that vote?
Wait and see, there will be new orders, soon.

321
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.740
I waited long enough, you..

322
00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:30.000
Mr. Sorel, be glad the JAG corps didn't
publish legal bases for unspoken insults yet!

323
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.100
Commander Logan made a decision,
there will be no further discussion.

324
00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.400
This conversation is over!

325
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.780
What's the matter?

326
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.680
Dormason and I join Remar's
landing party, that's all I know.

327
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.260
That's enough!

328
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.680
Matching our velocity to that of the planet.

329
00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.340
I have to modulate the shields, we have strong interferences. Temporal shields are fluctuating.

330
00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.640
Mr. T'Olverine, redirect additional energy!

331
00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:13.020
All system are working at maximum,
artificial warp field is forming.

332
00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.600
That's an enormous density of chroniton particles.

333
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.500
Redirecting auxiliary power to the deflector.

334
00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.960
I'm afraid there will be questions.

335
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.260
Everything is working now.

336
00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.640
Remar, what is the status of your landing party?

337
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.620
>>I'll need time for the preparations, Sir.
At least one hour.

338
00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.540
>>The Arethrazine treatment will take time as well.

339
00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:50.500
We will reach the planet in
15 minutes and 21 seconds.

340
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.640
With Arethrazine you should take your time.

341
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.400
Actually, the proper use of this
stuff is against theta radiation poisoning.

342
00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.740
You'll get your team as soon as possible, Logan.

343
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.500
>>By the way, Logan, have an eye on Sorel,
he seems 'displeased' by the situation.

344
00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:08.340
Thank you, Doctor.
Remar, I will transfer some files

345
00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:13.620
to your quarters, this should
accelerate your preparations. Logan Out.

346
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.480
Come in!

347
00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.780
Oh, you are here? With all this
current secretiveness I suspected

348
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.780
you would cancel our date
without getting back to me.

349
00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.640
No, I'm not that kind of guy.

350
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.540
Hope treated me first, so I
have some time before beaming down.

351
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.360
Do you know by now what's the matter?

352
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:43.000
No, Remar doesn't come out with it
and our tasks don't give a hint, either.

353
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.700
He sais the planet we are about
to beam down to is about to collapse.

354
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.660
But I'm not here to talk about that.

355
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.100
Oh my, do you want me to cry
and wave my handkerchief

356
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.240
watching you ride into the
sunset in your shining armour?

357
00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.500
Oh well, something like that would be nice, yes.

358
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.560
Sometimes I have the feeling
they cryopreserved you in the 20th century

359
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.880
and brought you back 400 years later.

360
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.560
Concerning romance they
were really inventive back then.

361
00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.320
Whatever, the same was said
about people from the 18th century.

362
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.920
Those were dark times, Tom.
I'm also a member of Starfleet,

363
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.040
I won't advise you to come back
with your shield, or on it.

364
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:26.940
But I tell you this: If you miss our date
on the holodeck in 2 days, I'll kick your butt.

365
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.960
Oh, don't worry. I won't miss that.

366
00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:37.440
You'd better not! But since you are
that into romantic gestures, here, take this.

367
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.500
What's that?

368
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:44.460
A treasure to remind you of me and
to bring back to the woman you leave behind.

369
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.800
Well, it's a rigellian pattern
enhancer, state of the art.

370
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.620
But I'd still be happy if you brought it back.

371
00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.500
And shall I hold this treasure
close to my heart, fair maiden?

372
00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.400
Better attach it to your
tricorder or else it won't work.

373
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.260
>>Remar to Jones.

374
00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.740
This is Jones.

375
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.500
>>Ensign, Commander Logan gave me
access to reports of previous missions

376
00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:18.260
>>so I could complete my preparations way earlier.
We'll meet immediately in transporter room 1.

377
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.240
We'll catch up on that!

378
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.560
Our diffusion field seems to work.
The black hole and the planet keep us

379
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:09.000
and our people out of sight.
The team started marking the molecules.

380
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.580
The transfer to the chamber is prepaired.

381
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.360
Maintain cover behind the planet
and load plasma torpedoes.

382
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.340
They are almost directly over our team.
I think, they will send a landing party.

383
00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.620
Come on, guys, take some of
the weapons, we'll go down.

384
00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.920
Stay on alert, up here, and tell
our team down there to expect visitors.

385
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.120
That's really a cosy spot you chose for us.

386
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:20.120
The planet starts destabilising,
we don't have much time. That way!

387
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.980
Sir, there is something ahead.
It doesn't look natural.

388
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.540
The tricorder is disturbed,
there's almost nothing to see.

389
00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.760
Remar to K'Ehleyr!

390
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.080
>>We have massive interferences,
I receive the resonance frequency

391
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:42.460
>>of the Omega molecules. They are here,
but I couldn't determine their position.

392
00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:46.220
The communication is very faint,
too, Remar. According to the sensors

393
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.720
the energy source is very close to you.
Just keep moving east.

394
00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.480
There's something else, Sir, we are not the first here.

395
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.200
Take cover!

396
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.740
We are under attack!

397
00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.980
...some russian curse...

398
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.000
Ratine, we're done here by 70%
and hold them at bay pretty well.

399
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.380
Interrupt their communication,
before they get into mischief.

400
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.180
>>Already done.
It's just four people, go and get them.

401
00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.340
Communication is interrupted,
the sensors cannot get through.

402
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.200
We don't know who we are dealing with.

403
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.300
Gravemetric torpedo loaded, Sir.

404
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.500
Not yet. No being with common sense would
detonate Omega while standing next to it.

405
00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.500
Scan for further ships.
Lt. T'Olverine, try to get a fix on the landing party.

406
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.800
Aye, Sir.

407
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:48.960
In position.

408
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:54.860
In position.

409
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.020
another russian curse XD

410
00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.580
In position.

411
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.160
In position.

412
00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.900
Seems like we got rid of them.

413
00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:37.240
Who besides us is crazy enough to
hang around on a planet that close to a black hole?

414
00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.640
I can't tell you that,
but I think they want the same as we do.

415
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.200
We'll take up position over there,
try to get communication back up

416
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.340
and Dormason takes over rear cover.

417
00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.740
Sir, I know that our mission is top
secret, but you should know we were

418
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.960
under fire by a Bajoran phaser.

419
00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.260
How's that possible?
We are at the edge of the gamma quadrant,

420
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.100
here are no Bajorans - besides Winston.

421
00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.820
I know that.
But the behavior on impact,

422
00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.900
the sound of the plasma stroke,
the repetition frequency,

423
00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.860
that's unambiguously a 2377s
phaser of Bajoran production.

424
00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:34.660
I'll better not ask what you're
doing in your free time to know that.

425
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.980
You security guys are curious people.

426
00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.660
They're taking shelter over there.
Meanwhile, the planet is going down.

427
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.940
We have to find out what they know about Omega.

428
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.380
The marking is done and
the transporter enhancer is active, Captain.

429
00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.020
Ratine just waits for the right moment
to beam the molecules to the station.

430
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.240
OK. Stay here.
You both take them under fire.

431
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:01.760
Yes!

432
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.160
We surround them.

433
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.500
To make that clear: We only confront them.

434
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.720
As per Starfleet protocoll we have
the right to doubt questionable orders.

435
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.880
We'll see. Come on!

436
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.260
At present, you are not granted access to the bridge.

437
00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.260
I order you to leave it instantly.

438
00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.880
Do you know how many security
regulations you just infringed?

439
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.660
We won't go until we know what's going on.

440
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.740
I look out of the window
and see you're endangering us all.

441
00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.560
I'm head of the KAT. You passed me over!

442
00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.660
Jones to K'Ehleyr, do you read me?
We request immediate evacuation!

443
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.160
What the heck?!

444
00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.060
Mr. T'Olverine?

445
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.880
Not quite, I suppose. What a nice surprise.

446
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.460
Remar!

447
00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:26.660
Remar to K'Ehleyr, do you read me?
Evacuation, now!

448
00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:12.860
Moxx!

449
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.820
Jones to Ratine.
We're done here.

450
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:30.340
Initiate transport of Omega,
beam us up and prime weapons.

451
00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.800
Get off the bridge before
endangering the vessle even more!

452
00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.040
The Omega Directive does not allow
me to read anyone else into this.

453
00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.980
So why does Dormason know?

454
00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.320
He does not. Nevertheless is he taking his
duties far more seriously than you are right now.

455
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.060
Sir, I only could get a fix
on Remar, then I lost the signal.

456
00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:59.180
Damn it! When I ride a nutshell
into a hurricane I want to know why!

457
00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.860
Your lack of comprehension and discipline is a
greater danger to us than this black hole out there.

458
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.420
You shouldn't make me more angry, petaQ!

459
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.800
Chenara to Security.

460
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.120
Send a team to the bridge to take
Warrant Officer Sorel to the brig.

461
00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.290
Damage report, Lieutenant.

462
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.720
The ablative armour prevented a hull breach, Sir.

463
00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.740
Impulse engines are heavily damaged,
warp field is fluctuating.

464
00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:44.040
Shields are re-establishing.
We have malfunctions in the temporal shields

465
00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:48.220
thus space time distortion over the whole ship.

466
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.080
They caught us during the transport process.

467
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.440
Complete analysis, Mr. Lasar.

468
00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:00.460
Analysing. The sensor interferences
prevented a clear scan of the area,

469
00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.720
the vessle must have been hidden behind the planet.

470
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.720
Sir, as per data base it is a T'Khasi ship.

471
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.240
T'Khasi? How did they get here?

472
00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.560
I did not fail to notice you two are still here.

473
00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.960
Given the current situation
I will refrain from punishment.

474
00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.900
Tal'Aura, report to sick bay,
there surely are casualties.

475
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.400
When you are done,
please send Dr. Hope back up here.

476
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.960
Mr. Phenix, go to the engine room,
there will be enough tasks for you.

477
00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.160
Aye, Sir!

478
00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.640
Eventually, you should really tell the crew, Sir.

479
00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.220
Sir, I have important data.

480
00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:53.520
This contains all information
we need for returning to our universe?

481
00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.940
What about the data base of the Valor?

482
00:45:55.940 --> 00:46:00.800
By default, the data base of each
rebel ship is deleted every 20 minutes.

483
00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:05.220
Thus the alliance won't get
relevant data in case of a takeover.

484
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.760
I know that Jones programmed
the Warbird in the same manner.

485
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:14.300
All necessary specification
exclusively are on this PADD and in my head.

486
00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.120
That's what I wanted to hear.

487
00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.520
T'Jul to McElroy, what is your status?

488
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.620
We are done here, basically we are just
waiting for the Valor to transfer the molecules.

489
00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:29.980
Efficient.

490
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.880
Open the docking clamps, we are
ready to transfer Omega to the ship.

491
00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.780
Besides, we brought you something to play with.

492
00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:50.980
You wanted to know something about this universe,
we collected some natives on the way.

493
00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:54.920
Question them, I want to know
what data they have about Omega

494
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.700
and why they are here in the gamma quadrant.

495
00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.340
Though I appreciate your offer,
it contradicts logic

496
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.240
to delay the Omega transfer for that.

497
00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.000
You won't.

498
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.980
Sorel, you take care of guests,
the rest of us initiates the transfer.

499
00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.320
Sheelah shall work on the connecting wires.

500
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.640
The transfer is going to begin as planned.
Sheelah, however, will be of no help.

501
00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.960
What? Why? What happened?

502
00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.300
She's dead.

503
00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.180
There was an energy discharge.

504
00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.700
Damn! Well, we go on as planned.

505
00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:00.460
How much longer will you be
working on repairing the engines?

506
00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.160
It should be done in 23 minutes.

507
00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:08.440
Similar repairs took me 17 minutes
and 44 seconds on average.

508
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.820
Ask me again in 15 minutes.

509
00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:14.840
Does the data base contain information
about encounters with other universes?

510
00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.840
Our knowlegde about this universe
in particular is very limited.

511
00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:22.100
Due to breaches of the Temporal Directive
there were alternative timelines

512
00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:28.540
and inside a graviton ellipse in sector 776
different parallel universes came together.

513
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:32.520
Additonally there are reports
of the USS Kelvin and the USS Enterprise

514
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.180
about contacts to other universes.

515
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.080
I read the Kelvin's report.

516
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.280
In this universe, Vulcan
and Romulus were destroyed.

517
00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.620
It is agreeable we are not to be there.

518
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.500
In both cases they met a
so-called United Federation of Planets.

519
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.880
But according to the tricorder data
of Mr. Remar the aggressors are not

520
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.380
related to a corresponding Starfleet.

521
00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.180
Also, they had a Warbird of the T'Khasi.

522
00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:03.200
They attacked us, we shouldn't just
let them get away with the Omega molecules.

523
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.080
Who is this? Hello? Dormason, wake up!

524
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.000
How many lights do you see?

525
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.600
Lights? Stop it, there is just one light!

526
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:24.900
That's correct.

527
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.300
The engine are again working
within standard parameters.

528
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.300
Ok. Priority 1 now is to
secure the Omega molecules,

529
00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.920
priority 2 is the members
of our landing party.

530
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.180
I can't say I like this ranking, Logan.

531
00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.660
The Omega Directive overrides all other priorities.

532
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:08.700
Commander, I spotted the plasma signature
of the vessle, we can pursue it.

533
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.740
I don't think they will use their
cloaking device in this area.

534
00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:18.620
Well, we can't, it would influence
our temporal shields way to much.

535
00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.820
Lay in pursuit course.
Auxiliary power to the sensors.

536
00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:25.480
Remar, you take the science station
and go on evaluating the data.

537
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.740
Logan to Dax, please come to the bridge!

538
00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:28.840
>>On my way!

539
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.780
This time they will not
catch us with our pants down.

540
00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:13.620
V'tosh ka'tur. T'Olverine is
not in control of himself anymore.

541
00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:15.580
Jones, who are they?
What do they want from us?

542
00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:19.380
In this room, you do not ask questions.
I ask them, you answer.

543
00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.380
If I'm not satisfied with those answers...

544
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:22.600
...you will die.

545
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.060
Why did you attack us?
We were on exploratory mission!

546
00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.800
Sorel? Is that you?

547
00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:37.320
That's not Sorel. These are some
doppelgangers, I saw them before on the planet.

548
00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.680
What do you know about the Omega molecule?

549
00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.860
Commander, I have something on screen.

550
00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:55.520
Specify.

551
00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.940
A station, Sir, architecture
typical for the Union,

552
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.680
the impulse signature is leading there.

553
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.160
On screen.

554
00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.880
Visual observation not yet possible.

555
00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:09.760
The Union does not keep
outposts in this area,

556
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:13.860
it must have been built by
the people of the parallel universe.

557
00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:16.100
Lay in course, full impulse.

558
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:16.600
Aye, Sir.

559
00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.060
Red alert!

560
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.440
Name and rank?

561
00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:24.020
Rogal Dormason, Warrant Officer.

562
00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.460
What is your current assignment?

563
00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:29.120
Escort the science officier
and support the engineers

564
00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:32.020
establishing the pattern enhancers.

565
00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.520
They are ready.
Keep the serum at that level.

566
00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:38.640
Let us begin again. What do
you know about the Omega molecule?

567
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.940
Nothing. Everything is under
concealment, we were not informed.

568
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.980
It is not logical to adjourn to an
instable planet near a black hole

569
00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.160
without knowledge of the mission.

570
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.120
Your name and rank?

571
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.140
Tom Jones, Ensign.

572
00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:55.740
Are you part of the T'Khasi alliance?

573
00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:01.740
T'Khasi? A fascinating question.
Tell me about this alliance.

574
00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:03.840
Find it out by yourself!

575
00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:09.220
This is what we are doing right know.
It is not logical to defy the interrogation.

576
00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:13.160
The T'Khasi Alliance was founded
in 2090 and is controlling

577
00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:17.160
almost the whole beta quadrant.
Well, as far as we explored it.

578
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.140
What about the Romulans?

579
00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.880
I always wanted to know what this thing
is capable of. She asked you something!

580
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.120
Ouch!!

581
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.580
Hm, I was expecting more!

582
00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.720
Romulus is some insignificant
planet somewhere in the Alliance.

583
00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.920
It is the first colony of the Remans.

584
00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.740
This is a remarkable deviation to other universes.

585
00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:40.360
Listen, if you wanna take history
classes, file an application to Starfleet.

586
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:45.140
You are still misjudging
your situation, Ensign Jones.

587
00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.620
What do you know about the Omega molecule?

588
00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.280
I wouldn't have bet on them
to fix their engines that fast.

589
00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:01.420
That's a problem. During the
transfer we cannot undock the vessle.

590
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.420
We are an easy target.

591
00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:05.300
Can you speed it up somehow?

592
00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.720
That's difficult. I'll have
to connect the power systems

593
00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.400
of the Warbird with the station
to enhance shields and phasers,

594
00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.700
but that will buy us the time needed. Join me!

595
00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:14.580
Aye!

596
00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:17.920
Jones to T'Jul.

597
00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.200
Mr. Jones, to achieve the optimal
result interrogations are subject

598
00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.940
to strict standards that
were refined for centuries.

599
00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:38.200
It is unacceptable that you
interrupt the scheduled procedure.

600
00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.800
Whatever. There are more
important things to do!

601
00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:44.260
The K'ehleyr will start to shell
us, but the transfer isn't done yet.

602
00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.220
Most propably they'll
also send an away team.

603
00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.320
I will put the extermination
unit in standby mode.

604
00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:53.520
Calculation of probability suggests
they will try to regain Omega.

605
00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:02.760
We'd rather try and take the station
or at least deactivate it on site.

606
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.400
If we just destroy it
there'll be too much of a risk

607
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.720
to destabilize the subspace.

608
00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:11.000
Up to now I equipped 10
torpedoes with gravimetric charges,

609
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.780
that could be enough
should necessity require it.

610
00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:17.700
'Could'? That is much of a
variable when dealing with Omega.

611
00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:22.700
I think the doctor is right, we
should send a team to examine on the spot.

612
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.320
Half of the K'Ehleyr Away Team
attempted to rebel here,

613
00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.960
not really trustworthy.

614
00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:31.740
They have the training to do it.

615
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.960
Omega has to be secured.

616
00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.780
Tell me when we approach
the station by 6 mio kilometers.

617
00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:39.560
Aye, Sir.

618
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.760
Hope, you have the bridge.

619
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:27.440
Are you in good health? Do you have
any physical ailments I should know about?

620
00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:31.240
Torture has never been a reliable
means of extracting information.

621
00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.760
It is ultimately self-defeating
as a means of control.

622
00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:38.320
One wonders that it's still practiced.

623
00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.700
Beautiful, isn't it?

624
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:53.000
You don't understand it, do you?
You got the wrong guys,

625
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.560
our officer got away. Omega is top secret!

626
00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.860
From this point on, you will
enjoy no privilege of rank,

627
00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:04.600
no privileges of person.
From now on, I will refer

628
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:08.540
to you only as human.
You have no other identity.

629
00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:10.540
What do you know about Omega?

630
00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.240
The literature of many species
is of full of situations like this.

631
00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.460
The hero falls back on an
antagonist to fight a greater evil.

632
00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:46.520
Oh, and you want to tell me
you are the hero in this story, Sir?

633
00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:50.360
I am an officer of Starfleet.
The antagonist is either purified

634
00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.680
or stabs the hero in the back once again.

635
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:57.120
So to speak 'fight fire with fire'.
Or do you want to suggest something else?

636
00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:01.000
The Omega Directive overrides
all other priorities. It sets

637
00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:04.400
us back to a premodern time.
If you are a relict of this time,

638
00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:07.760
better stay on the station
after completing your mission.

639
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.420
That's for sure, Sir. Safety kills freedom.

640
00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:23.600
But I promise you this. I'll come back.

641
00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:27.500
The final frontier has lines
that should not be crossed.

642
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.780
You will get your orders
from Commander Lasar and

643
00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:31.800
Arethrazine from Dr. Hope.

644
01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.360
I found something nice. Hey!

645
01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.460
Sorry, I only got one Taser.

646
01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:11.320
Mr. Sorel has an irrational preference
for these pre-civilizing methods.

647
01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:15.900
Yet, there are techniques far more advanced.
The Cardassian and the Terran Empire

648
01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:20.620
under Hoshi Sato were highly
resourceful designing these instruments.

649
01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.500
For Mr. Sorel, though, too many
memories of his childhood

650
01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.880
are associated with it.

651
01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.180
Let me demonstrate.

652
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.120
You hide behind your logic
and pretend being without emotion

653
01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.820
and yet you are a sadistic rugrat just like him.

654
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.160
Silence!

655
01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.860
This device can stimulate the pain
centre of virtually any humanoid.

656
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.920
A synaptic scan calibrates it for each species.

657
01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.860
The sensors continually shift the
stimulation from one nerve cluster

658
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.700
to another, keeping the subject
in a constant state of agony.

659
01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.100
This was the lowest possible adjustment.

660
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.280
What do you know about the Omega molecule?

661
01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:10.420
Sorel, plan B.

662
01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:13.220
In light of the external
circumstances we will have

663
01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.920
to precipitate our conversation.
This will take a lot of focus.

664
01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:16.840
Obnoxious...

665
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:21.160
He is merely stunned, no
reason for an emotional reaction.

666
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:30.660
My mind to your mind,
my thoughts to your thoughts.

667
01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.240
Their shields are at 95%.

668
01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.340
Fire quantum torpedoes.

669
01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:11.520
The shields of the station
are fluctuating. Our team is in.

670
01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.780
The station remodulated its shields.

671
01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.340
They must have tapped the
Warbird's shield emitters.

672
01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.140
We have company, a shuttle has docked.

673
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:34.160
That's too fast.
Activate him and open a chanel.

674
01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:39.080
This is Tom Jones of the
Terran Resistance. I want to talk

675
01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.640
to the Captain of this vessle.

676
01:02:41.008 --> 01:02:43.548
This is Commander Logan
of the USS K'Ehleyr.

677
01:02:43.548 --> 01:02:48.960
Surrender and immediately hand over
all Omega molecules and our crew members.

678
01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:51.420
They have androids as captains,
what's going on here?

679
01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:53.420
We have to temporize with them.

680
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.560
You have no power here, machine!
If just one member of your crew

681
01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:05.200
should enter our station,
I will have the prisoners executed.

682
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:09.180
Given the threat Omega poses
all casualties are tolerable.

683
01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.220
Would he be a life form
I'd say he's bluffing.

684
01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:33.000
There are many interferences,
the tricorder shows impossible

685
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.600
amounts of energy on the station.
No signs of life forms.

686
01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:41.360
I found identically constructed
stations in our universe,

687
01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.400
I loaded the building plans
to the tricorders, that should

688
01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.740
be enough for our orientation.

689
01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.940
System loading.
Weapons init...
Visual display init...

690
01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.800
Intruders detected.

691
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.920
Objective: Termination.

692
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.520
Call them!

693
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.000
What do you want to do?

694
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.160
Negotiate!

695
01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:26.240
Cease fire!

696
01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.440
Lieutenant Moxx,

697
01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.660
you are aware that I can not
back down under the present conditions?

698
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.860
Sir, those people torture and kill,
they mustn't get Omega. Prevent...

699
01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.140
>>Are you totally out of you mind??

700
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.920
You fought criminals for so long
you yourself became one!

701
01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:49.200
Fight fire with fire.
I'll get the next one!

702
01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.820
Letting him get away with that
threathens all we fought for.

703
01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.640
We are the good guys.

704
01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.460
I'll take care of him!

705
01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:00.740
Keep firing, damn it!

706
01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.100
What is that?

707
01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.060
Get down!

708
01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.840
Phenix, Winston, fallback!
We'll cover you!

709
01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.380
Seleia, fallback, I'll follow.

710
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:45.900
Terminate intruders. Protective shield unstable.

711
01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.600
The weapons of this machine
destroyed my protective shield!

712
01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.060
Logan, they are killing
our people over there!

713
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.720
Lieutenant Commander Hope,
this discussion is over.

714
01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:26.400
The priorities are unambiguous.
Each further delay only threatens

715
01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.920
our remaining team members!

716
01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:30.800
Oh, sorry, it would be so nice if
each one of us had an emotion chip!

717
01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:33.700
If we look after our crew members
this way, there is no more need

718
01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.380
for a doctor on this bridge. 
I'm in sick bay!

719
01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.780
Our shields are down to 37%, Sir.

720
01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:45.140
Theirs are at 55%, loading more torpedoes.

721
01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.840
Find something to hold on to,
we are directly at the outer hull!

722
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:27.140
Winston to  K'Ehleyr, do you read me?

723
01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.640
Affirmative, loud and clear.

724
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.320
>>We need a locally restricted
EM pulse to the coordinates

725
01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:35.520
I sent you with my tricorder. Posthaste!

726
01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:41.330
I can modify our tractor beam
accordingly and narrow the

727
01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:45.430
emitter's opening angle to prevent
the KAT's equipment being affected.

728
01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:49.500
Their shield grid is fluctuating
in this section, it might work.

729
01:12:54.300 --> 01:13:00.040
Primary weapon damaged...
Activate secondary weapon...

730
01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:18.480
He must be connected to their main
computer to know all their shield harmonics.

731
01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:23.080
Deactivate tricorders,
have new energy cells ready.

732
01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:26.080
Just in case, the pulse hits
close-by systems and our devices.

733
01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.960
I will be..back..

734
01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.660
Hasta la vista, Baby.

735
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:07.260
McElroy to Jones, we are done
here, the transfer is complete.

736
01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.300
Drop it!

737
01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.800
Their shields are at 20%.

738
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.800
Commander, they're calling us.

739
01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:22.200
Give it a bone! We're done here,
what do you care about our universe?

740
01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.520
Indeed, the Union's laws do
not cover parallel universes.

741
01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:29.480
However, as officer of Starfleet
I can not just turn a blind eye.

742
01:16:31.044 --> 01:16:35.004
Klingons, Cardassians, Romulans,
they all joined forces against us!

743
01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:39.004
Under Omega the old society will tremble!

744
01:16:39.024 --> 01:16:43.004
The last word Wisdom ever has to say:
He only earns his Freedom

745
01:16:43.024 --> 01:16:47.004
and Existence,
Who’s forced to win them freshly every day.

746
01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.220
Omega will leave nothing
to build your new society from.

747
01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.480
You'll get your team as
soon as possible, Logan.

748
01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:02.100
Red alert!
Chenara, activate cloaking device.

749
01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.880
You are engineers. Repair that!

750
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.300
...you will die.

751
01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:10.700
The warp engine was reinforced
with multi phase shields...

752
01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:13.720
Not quite, I suppose.
What a nice surprise.

753
01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.740
Good timing. Thank you.

754
01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.360
We are just doing our job, lady.

755
01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.620
Take care, Tom.

756
01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.480
Don’t worry, old man.
I will be back in no time at all.

757
01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:28.540
I won't advise you to come
back with your shield, or on it.

758
01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:34.780
This is Commander Logan. Due to the
top security level Omega Directive

759
01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:38.680
there will be changes in the
schedule within the next hours.

760
01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:41.800
What's the matter?

761
01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.360
Dormason and I join Remar's
landing party, that's all I know.

762
01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:49.200
We have massive interferences,
I receive the resonance

763
01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:52.200
frequency of the Omega molecules.

764
01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:55.600
They are here, but I couldn't
determine their position.

765
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.120
Wanted to hook yourself
a Jones as well, didn't you?

766
01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.300
Drop it, now!

767
01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:23.840
You mistake me, we all
just want to leave here, too.

768
01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:25.680
No! Don't do that, Tom!

769
01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:28.960
I need her. Whatever she did
to you she will be prosecuted.

770
01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:32.460
Just let us go. Jones?

771
01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:44.580
Sorel!

772
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.480
What do we have here?

773
01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.940
The anomaly is closing.
Pursuit course, Sir?

774
01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:32.140
Negative. The Omega molecules are
no longer detected by our sensors,

775
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.140
the Omega Directive thereby is abrogated.

776
01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.340
We lost!

777
01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.600
Sorel and the others are on their way back.

778
01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:55.840
System reboot. Visual display init...

779
01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:11.580
They took the station's energy core
with them. Auxiliary batteries will

780
01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:15.080
last for only a few minutes before the
station will be drawn into the black hole.

781
01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:19.980
Cancel read alert.
Helm, lay in course to New Hope.

782
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.220
Take us away from here. Energize!

783
01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:23.080
Aye, Sir.

784
01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.880
So far so good.

785
01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.440
Thanks, doctor. Where is Tom?

786
01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:47.820
I sent him to his quarters. In contrast
to Dormason he is in good physical health,

787
01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.800
they must have healed him. It's his
mental condition that worries me.

788
01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:55.800
Though the agonizer didn't cause
permanent damage, I read Dr. McCoys

789
01:21:55.820 --> 01:22:00.000
essays about mind melts and I think
it's you he needs now, Counselor.

790
01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:02.800
Will he recover?

791
01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:07.620
I'll keep him here as long as his
neural pathways regenerate from the

792
01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.620
electroshocks. But yes, he'll
be alright. You can talk to him.

793
01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:20.900
I don't know how to start. It was..

794
01:22:21.467 --> 01:22:23.467
I can...imagine, Tom.

795
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:32.320
I'm naked in the dark.
There's nothing...

796
01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:37.500
no veil between me and her.
She sees everything I know,

797
01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:42.700
all my memories, my whole life.
It is beyond words.

798
01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:48.040
I start seeing it with my waking eyes.
It simply was atrocious.

799
01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:54.900
I'll help you cope with the pain.
We'll create new memories.

800
01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.320
Maybe this Sorel has been abused
once, so he became what he is.

801
01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:06.520
Who knows what that T'Khasi did to him.
I don't want that for anybody.

802
01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.380
Vulcan without logic...

803
01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:21.300
Clean your spirit.
But bear the blame. Forever.

804
01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:44.920
Sir, there are strange
readings on the sensors.

805
01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:48.320
A ship is approaching
extremely fast, with slipstream.

806
01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:49.340
Yellow Alert.

807
01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:53.640
Slipstream? I though this
would be in testing phase.

808
01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:59.020
This is Captain Lucsly,
of the time ship DeLorean.

809
01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:02.140
Commander, you and your
crew don't belong here,

810
01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.140
you are 400 years in the future.

811
