a ring of money to it. I want to call
that no longer than six oz two on but

12
00:03:15.40 --> 00:03:22.06
no fight one three hundred.
Let's say I'm the patron of

13
00:03:22.11 --> 00:03:27.70
science. But I can promise
results not promises.

14
00:03:33.13 --> 00:03:39.15
I don't understand you're trusting him so
much money Giles is a miracle drug but

00:03:39.19 --> 00:03:41.27
a bit like lent.

16
00:03:44.11 --> 00:03:58.97

not if I can give in life. That's where

25
00:05:00.11 --> 00:05:06.70
anything anything including your own
life even that. One to succeed in

26
00:05:06.71 --> 00:05:12.96
creating life is the ultimate achievement
to have attained the seer. To doubt now

27
00:05:12.97 --> 00:05:19.88
would. Think everything I've ever
done pointless is empty. This is.

28
00:05:21.08 --> 00:05:26.43
This is my life. To create life
should man leap that to bottom.

29
00:05:28.28 --> 00:05:35.15
Out on that one man it got
on the go to bed child

00:06:56.53 --> 00:07:02.71
twenty but tell me about the University.
Except for my studies it was rather boring

39
00:07:03.35 --> 00:07:10.21
but I didn't go there to socialize and
cheaply. I'm like my father. When I want

40
00:07:10.22 --> 00:07:15.28
something. And I think
first of my class I'm now

41

a life. DOCTOR.

42
00:07:29.56 --> 00:07:30.35

00:08:04.90 --> 00:08:11.79
a story many times doesn't matter
father the charming story. You

49
00:08:11.80 --> 00:08:16.70
know the name Frankenstein still echoes
in the halls of the university I'm not

50
00:08:16.71 --> 00:08:21.40
surprised but I stopped caring about those
photos when I left them up and clapped

51
00:08:21.41 --> 00:08:27.89
over there as thirty years ago. I
think that down to larger like the

52
00:08:27.90 --> 00:08:33.93
tide no response thank
you. Was it difficult

53
00:08:34.71 --> 00:08:41.29
I mean very difficult speaking my
daughter. Mostly it was my being

54
00:08:41.30 --> 00:08:45.08
a woman the professors have a lot
of old fashioned ideas about

55
00:08:45.09 --> 00:08:47.71
a woman's place I'm sure you will make

56
00:08:47.72 --> 00:08:52.36
a fine surgeon Thank you. But
I do not want to be merely

57
00:08:52.37 --> 00:08:59.19
a fine surgeon what do you want.
To assist you further in your

58
00:08:59.20 --> 00:09:01.70
work. You think I was

59
00:09:01.71 --> 00:09:08.66
a youngster I was always interested in
your. It's summer when I was here. I

60
00:09:08.67 --> 00:09:09.44
was speaking to

61
00:09:09.45 --> 00:09:16.17
a laboratory. But it was
always locked I know. When I

62
00:09:16.18 --> 00:09:20.09
discovered the other one.
The one the one bedroom.

63
00:09:21.72 --> 00:09:27.57
The room you little devil.
I was always curious.

64
00:09:32.30 --> 00:09:37.71
And curious to you have far you
progress. In the show you my own plan.

65
00:09:39.42 --> 00:09:43.68
I shall be delighted to discuss
cause as doctor to doctor.

66
00:09:48.12 --> 00:09:53.64
But I miss going to my
ideas and reading. You.

67
00:09:57.42 --> 00:10:03.81
Because. I am my father's
don't. You are referring to

68
00:10:04.14 --> 00:10:07.51
animal transplant. Human.

69
00:10:19.19 --> 00:10:25.79
By another hundred disorders very
delicate. People to be paid and that's

70
00:10:26.38 --> 00:10:32.04
why people. Well Baron
You know I can tell you

71
00:10:33.08 --> 00:10:38.51
professional ethics don't speak to me of
ethics if you want what you want it will

72
00:10:38.52 --> 00:10:45.39
cost you another hundred the way I see
it Baron You don't have any choice

73
00:10:48.01 --> 00:10:48.71
I have to get it for

74
00:10:49.22 --> 00:10:53.50
a good time and don't worry I won't sit
down I wouldn't want to damage this

75
00:10:53.72 --> 00:10:54.88
wonderful furniture.

76
00:11:00.71 --> 00:11:07.28
And Q.'s. I was looking for my father

77
00:11:08.39 --> 00:11:14.86
with that they don't have much of it would
know that I never thought the Baron

78
00:11:14.87 --> 00:11:21.76
added in him but Dr Marshall will.
Know now time is best and I

79
00:11:22.41 --> 00:11:28.39
drink. Much too and
never too early for you

80
00:11:30.86 --> 00:11:37.77
my dear. You are not noxious man
extremely vulgar and I'm certain that

81
00:11:37.78 --> 00:11:42.84
what everyone thinking is merely fantasy
on your part. I would say did you spend

82
00:11:42.85 --> 00:11:49.18
too much time alone in your fantasies
please. Be careful to soften the brain far

83
00:11:49.19 --> 00:11:54.81
quicker than whiskey. How can
somebody so lovely be such

84
00:11:54.82 --> 00:11:57.49
a bitch depends on the company I'm.

00:12:01.94 --> 00:12:07.06

What. I hope Mr Moggs brain is go up.

164
00:23:00.91 --> 00:23:04.88
So for the past twenty years my experiments
with animal transplants have been

165
00:23:04.89 --> 00:23:11.12
pointed to this week all the abuse I've
been doing my friends all the accusations

166
00:23:11.13 --> 00:23:17.30
against my sanity and worse will be thrown
into that sanctimonious face. Looking

167
00:23:17.31 --> 00:23:22.55
for something. I need to start
my final step in the lexical.

168
00:23:24.11 --> 00:23:29.41
From the light will give the creature life.
At five haven't transplanted the heart

169
00:23:29.42 --> 00:23:33.83
in the brain like and keep them alive
indefinitely in the laboratory but one side

170
00:23:33.84 --> 00:23:36.27
transplant them they'll survive only

171
00:23:36.28 --> 00:23:41.22
a few hours and that's activated by lightning
quick to see how you keep the mind

172
00:23:41.37 --> 00:23:47.76
the tail then you'll see
the problems you I will

173
00:23:48.64 --> 00:23:55.11
and the medical world will be brought to
it the one that So the you really like

Or or or.

235
00:31:45.46 --> 00:31:51.11
Fail to show. You what I. Should have
taken time to repair the brain that will

236
00:31:51.88 --> 00:31:56.65
probably make any difference effect if the
damage would only show after the brain

237
00:31:56.66 --> 00:32:01.32
was reacting well never though
at that level now it's more of

238
00:32:01.33 --> 00:32:04.34
a I think that may. Take

239
00:32:04.35 --> 00:32:08.41
a moment. And we can. Have

240
00:32:08.42 --> 00:32:14.97
a brain that. No use trying to make
me feel the need to like me. Bad

241
00:32:15.24 --> 00:32:15.62
Tanya

242
00:32:15.63 --> 00:32:24.35
a little bit. When you help.
But wait and see how you. Make

243
00:32:24.36 --> 00:32:29.31
me. Feel the same I don't even
know if I want to attempt

244
00:32:30.22 --> 00:32:35.34
a moment ago you said. That was
just self-indulgence the whole of.

245
00:32:37.35 --> 00:32:43.20
No no it was who can
say. I have. Managed to.

246
00:32:45.70 --> 00:32:46.65
Never thought I'd get my.

247
00:33:16.38 --> 00:33:16.84
Act out.

248
00:33:35.64 --> 00:33:39.57
If this is. Really only
taking place in the my.

249
00:34:05.26 --> 00:34:09.86
Lad. In Iran than.

250
00:34:18.25 --> 00:34:23.82
Some.

251
00:34:33.03 --> 00:34:37.22
We've got to. We've got to. Bring.

252
00:34:39.90 --> 00:34:41.12
You two can.

253
00:34:51.53 --> 00:34:56.39
Come. Home.

254
00:34:59.20 --> 00:35:06.00
From another. One

255
00:35:06.04 --> 00:35:12.47
Another them. Come. Home.

256
00:35:13.48 --> 00:35:16.76
On.

257
00:35:48.16 --> 00:35:49.95
What.

258
00:36:01.09 --> 00:36:03.41
He's done it's.

259
00:36:47.34 --> 00:36:48.59
A good.

260
00:37:09.92 --> 00:37:16.28
Time. Right now.

261
00:37:27.14 --> 00:37:32.00
Don Young much do you want to just break
your father's day that you're worried

262
00:37:32.01 --> 00:37:36.40
about his name you cannot keep
this from the police not.

263
00:37:39.07 --> 00:37:45.55
Only to question. That's
impossible but if it kills again

264
00:37:46.60 --> 00:37:53.50
its brain is damaged I want just
father but Tanya No we must address

265
00:37:54.42 --> 00:37:58.19
tell him. But it was

266
00:37:58.20 --> 00:38:05.16
a robbery. But there is
Morgan's body what did you

267
00:38:05.17 --> 00:38:08.82
do with the other corpses that lived back.

268
00:38:15.84 --> 00:38:22.75
Then you could go to hack. I
don't know. What could you

269
00:38:22.76 --> 00:38:24.18
hope to gain time.

270
00:38:31.32 --> 00:38:37.40
To think of some way to say I thought
that's what it takes. Didn't you love him

271
00:38:39.74 --> 00:38:43.71
you know I did do it for him and.

272
00:38:50.76 --> 00:38:50.97
I'm.

273
00:39:05.14 --> 00:39:05.52
I.

274
00:39:27.77 --> 00:39:27.87
Have

275
00:39:27.88 --> 00:39:35.25
a whole. Animal organs I believe yes

276
00:39:35.26 --> 00:39:41.100
because my father has been experimentally
an animal transplant very interesting

277
00:39:43.24 --> 00:39:47.76
you saw this rock a big
mess. She would have to be

278
00:39:47.77 --> 00:39:54.49
a very big man big enough
to. Know what did he

279
00:39:54.50 --> 00:39:59.35
steal nothing as far as I can tell I haven't
had time to check everything by Father

280
00:39:59.36 --> 00:40:06.26
but I'm surprised I would think it was
your father's surprise but. What would I

281
00:40:06.27 --> 00:40:09.36
rather be doing in a laboratory
he wouldn't have known it was

282
00:40:09.44 --> 00:40:16.29
a laboratory he must have seen the light
and he wanted to investigate perhaps you

283
00:40:16.30 --> 00:40:16.89
said he was

284
00:40:16.90 --> 00:40:23.80
a very big. Thing. I
don't know I was asleep

285
00:40:24.06 --> 00:40:30.04
at least half of what dollars and you
kept it up really that would make it more

286
00:40:30.05 --> 00:40:36.94
than seventy. Are you sure Dr March when
half with them after all it was running

287
00:40:36.95 --> 00:40:42.73
away when I saw him I thought you said
you saw him the better early yes but all

288
00:40:42.74 --> 00:40:45.21
that registered in my mind
then was this hulk of

289
00:40:45.22 --> 00:40:48.31
a man in the back and then you added

290
00:40:48.32 --> 00:40:53.55
a few moments after this Robert killed the
bear I tried to stop him but he threw me

291
00:40:53.56 --> 00:40:57.80
aside quite easily and I couldn't and that
was the time when you saw him run Yes

292
00:40:58.10 --> 00:41:03.77
but you weren't no I wasn't. Very far
too well I won't keep you any longer

293
00:41:05.28 --> 00:41:06.22
I'm sure this been

294
00:41:06.23 --> 00:41:13.03
a quite an ordeal. Oh by the

295
00:41:13.04 --> 00:41:19.25
way the young man. Tom.
He doesn't live here

296
00:41:20.07 --> 00:41:26.95
he comes each morning
there and back. He didn't

297
00:41:26.96 --> 00:41:32.04
believe us. Of course. He
just tried to race me.

298
00:41:33.95 --> 00:41:39.45
Your mother. Thank you. But now.

299
00:41:41.03 --> 00:41:47.87
Now we wait. For the right. Way.

300
00:41:55.30 --> 00:41:57.08
To get the last person.

301
00:42:22.38 --> 00:42:27.13
Nice cheerful place you have your land very
fashionable it's like something out of

302
00:42:27.14 --> 00:42:31.76
an insane asylum Yes you do have the
taste of a connoisseur the taste of

303
00:42:31.77 --> 00:42:37.53
a man who truly knows what is obscene
vulgar ironic and simply grotesque very

304
00:42:37.54 --> 00:42:42.94
clever the way everything blends together
things seem to balance that one piece out

305
00:42:42.95 --> 00:42:49.80
of place not one inch of space waste
is truly remarkable I am impressed

306
00:42:50.37 --> 00:42:57.27
Blanche. You are such
an ugly. What's wrong

307
00:42:57.28 --> 00:43:02.66
kept all your selves empty this
morning on the contrary as

308
00:43:02.67 --> 00:43:06.06
a matter of fact some friends of yours were
kind enough to spend the night with me

309
00:43:06.93 --> 00:43:11.97
I don't have any friends Oh but you do
they're Simon Burke and Harry MORRIS Not to

310
00:43:11.98 --> 00:43:16.30
mention Jim Turner and that other fellow
the little one with the hunchback. Where

311
00:43:16.31 --> 00:43:20.06
they drank their. You see they started

312
00:43:20.07 --> 00:43:26.79
a brawl in the top song you do know this
vaguely but one is for drunks have to do

313
00:43:26.80 --> 00:43:30.35
with me you see the fight was over which
one of them was going to pay for the

314
00:43:30.36 --> 00:43:35.20
entire bill which was quite substantial
your friends drink you know you still

315
00:43:35.21 --> 00:43:40.38
haven't answered my question or haven't I
well let me put it this way where to for

316
00:43:40.39 --> 00:43:44.25
such men come upon enough money for each
of them to be able to pay for himself and

317
00:43:44.26 --> 00:43:50.94
the other three maybe they earn
that maybe but doing what. Simon

318
00:43:50.95 --> 00:43:56.58
Harry they can't earn much after all how
many hangings do we have. And I'm sure you

319
00:43:56.59 --> 00:44:03.04
get less and to disappoint me I don't
pass sentence on anyone I only arrested

320
00:44:04.33 --> 00:44:09.99
drinking alone no he wasn't are you get.

321
00:44:12.08 --> 00:44:16.04
Two of those men work for you and I can't
see you playing anyone enough to buy

322
00:44:16.05 --> 00:44:18.31
a decent dinner let alone

323
00:44:18.32 --> 00:44:24.97
a night striking for four men. All right
camp then I wouldn't maybe they found

324
00:44:24.98 --> 00:44:26.41
other work something that they's

325
00:44:26.42 --> 00:44:32.46
a police captain's wages. I'm not laughing
Lanch just tell me what kind of work

326
00:44:32.47 --> 00:44:36.64
they do for you since you have no
legitimate business Oh I know you're

327
00:44:36.65 --> 00:44:41.99
a banker of sorts loaning out money at
exorbitant rates of interest but your hired

328
00:44:42.00 --> 00:44:44.14
help. They are going like there's

329
00:44:44.15 --> 00:44:51.41
a God like money for me
yeah I'm sure they do. Well

330
00:44:51.85 --> 00:44:55.30
I'll leave you to your Whatever a
man like you call the same thing

331
00:44:55.31 --> 00:45:00.46
a man like you because one day and age
you're going to tell me the wrong thing at

332
00:45:00.47 --> 00:45:06.44
the right time. It's useless time yet

333
00:45:07.86 --> 00:45:14.78
you won't find the solution
there there isn't one anyway I

334
00:45:14.79 --> 00:45:18.19
have the solution child.
I'm only looking for

335
00:45:18.20 --> 00:45:24.53
a way to make it happen
and you know if I can.

336
00:45:28.99 --> 00:45:35.54
Will you help me I cannot commit myself
until I know what you consider the solution

337
00:45:37.19 --> 00:45:42.52
another creature ten years took your
father and me three years to construct the

338
00:45:42.53 --> 00:45:46.82
first one mine would take less than three
weeks even if it took three hours it

339
00:45:46.83 --> 00:45:53.24
would be too late then the then another
canning too I didn't want to tell you

340
00:45:53.83 --> 00:46:00.22
I was in town today everyone in the village
is speaking about the monster that is

341
00:46:00.23 --> 00:46:05.23
what they call your father's life's work
are monster and they're right they are not

342
00:46:05.30 --> 00:46:07.81
right my father was

343
00:46:07.82 --> 00:46:14.77
a genius and his creation Well it will
do nothing but kill you don't understand

344
00:46:15.44 --> 00:46:18.88
even without the damage to the
brain the creature has the mind of

345
00:46:18.89 --> 00:46:23.85
a murderer it kills for the think of killing
it must be destroyed and Harris will

346
00:46:23.86 --> 00:46:25.26
destroy it how can

347
00:46:25.27 --> 00:46:32.13
a man destroy no chance there's
only one solution to create

348
00:46:32.14 --> 00:46:38.60
a second creature. You'll be
creating another monster not

349
00:46:38.61 --> 00:46:44.98
a monster an executioner our creature
will kill my father's matter no it's

350
00:46:44.99 --> 00:46:50.61
impossible even if you found the right
brain your creature despite the superhuman

351
00:46:50.62 --> 00:46:53.70
strength than dupes by the
lightning it would need

352
00:46:53.74 --> 00:46:58.51
a physical body strong enough to
support it where would you find such

353
00:46:58.52 --> 00:47:06.41
a man. And

354
00:47:06.42 --> 00:47:12.00
that's my proposition five hundred pounds
if you find me the right person now might

355
00:47:12.01 --> 00:47:18.23
make you think again. My father
till it's all written in his diary

356
00:47:19.39 --> 00:47:19.74
he gave you

357

want your prices too high then go peddle

362
00:47:43.52 --> 00:47:49.84

would find my father's diving in like.

363
00:47:51.50 --> 00:47:55.93
My sailing gods as would surprise anyone
but your father buying them now that would

364
00:47:55.94 --> 00:48:01.18
give everybody plenty to talk about and
wouldn't miss not think about it no one

365
00:48:01.19 --> 00:48:07.39
else can now you know. After all
watch one night out of your life

366
00:48:08.25 --> 00:48:10.75
getting killed you and
I have to you can take

367
00:48:10.76 --> 00:48:13.25
a bath and everything will be brand new.

368
00:48:17.82 --> 00:48:24.62
I will kill you I will kill you you
need to drink. I don't see why you're

369
00:48:24.63 --> 00:48:30.75
so upset and then like Lynch cannot be
taken seriously Still I would kill him for

370
00:48:30.76 --> 00:48:36.62
even suggesting but. I didn't know that
you felt so much about my reputation.

371
00:48:39.07 --> 00:48:45.37
I'm sorry of course you do you I sent
him and so you only think of me is

372
00:48:45.38 --> 00:48:52.17
untouchable you're wrong. Do you
ever think of the Genie I knew the.

373
00:48:53.18 --> 00:48:54.81
Does it really bother you to know that

374
00:48:54.82 --> 00:49:01.15
a man like Lynch desires me No only that
he was vulgar enough to reveal it to you

375
00:49:01.48 --> 00:49:06.90
you never really believed in my father's
dream you only stayed because of me What

376
00:49:06.91 --> 00:49:12.42
if I did and why didn't you tell me because
you were afraid you've always been

377
00:49:12.43 --> 00:49:19.21
afraid you were afraid now we don't
need Lynch. Often needed the chance.

378
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:28.72
I found him. Talk. Thomas
Yes Thomas physically he's

379
00:49:28.73 --> 00:49:32.82
perfect his body strong and beautiful
behind us wouldn't you like to have such

380
00:49:32.83 --> 00:49:37.88
a body what does that have to do with
everything because you love me I know you do

381
00:49:38.48 --> 00:49:42.22
but you've never done anything about it
instead of your love for me giving you

382
00:49:42.23 --> 00:49:46.67
strength you let it melt just by you let
it fester inside of you until all you

383
00:49:46.68 --> 00:49:51.94
could do was to look at me with those we
don't hurt I but the eyes of an old man

384
00:49:52.30 --> 00:49:52.79
with the eyes of

385
00:49:52.80 --> 00:49:56.04
a cripple look cripple who could never
even dream that I could love him.

386
00:49:59.90 --> 00:50:06.16
You could you love me yes

387
00:50:07.33 --> 00:50:14.29

00:54:44.54 --> 00:54:50.27
a robber out of the bread for it's Mrs
March alone now. Congratulation thank you

420
00:54:50.63 --> 00:54:56.00
and this man anyone seen him anyone's to
the line the young man who was with Sarah

421
00:54:56.01 --> 00:55:01.84
will John Masters and this Mr Masters
What did he see he claims it wasn't

422
00:55:01.85 --> 00:55:02.78
a man said it was

423
00:55:02.79 --> 00:55:07.56
a monster but he was too frightened to
satisfy me however there's one more witness

424
00:55:07.57 --> 00:55:13.15
I would believe who is the sort that can
suffer he saw the murderer kill his mother

425
00:55:13.49 --> 00:55:17.33
but the lads in shock if and
when I was ever able to talk to

00:55:24.06 --> 00:55:27.02
thank you you know I've been wondering
this is Marshall why would you visit Tom

428
00:55:27.03 --> 00:55:32.75
Lance especially at his place and at night
the Baron on him money and my wife went

429
00:55:32.76 --> 00:55:36.94
to pay it back wouldn't have been
better to send for him when he kept

430
00:55:37.52 --> 00:55:42.47
a man like Lynn Cheney of course but then
I would think Dr Marshall should have got

431
00:55:42.48 --> 00:55:47.70
not you it was my father's business which
made it mine nobody else is quite what I

432
00:55:47.71 --> 00:55:52.18

own Lynch might I find or probably the

01:14:33.55 --> 01:14:34.70
you just keep on coming back.

532
01:14:42.77 --> 01:14:43.16
I must be

533
01:14:43.17 --> 01:14:50.05
a doctor. I'm not asking your
permission. Yesterday I was just

534
01:14:50.86 --> 01:14:57.71
that crazy by far as I recall
you have no right. Are enough

535
01:14:57.93 --> 01:15:04.90
and I'm sorry. It's quite contagious you
shouldn't risk coming any closer I want

536
01:15:04.91 --> 01:15:09.68
to speak to you alone whatever you have
to say I want my life to him very well I

537
01:15:09.69 --> 01:15:13.25
came to warn you about the monster that
you went there and Frankenstein created I

538
01:15:13.26 --> 01:15:18.48
don't YOU are responsible in the deaths of
any people including the bear of course

539
01:15:18.49 --> 01:15:22.97
you can prove that if I could I would be
here to arrest you I know that you are my

540
01:15:22.98 --> 01:15:28.97
proof I want you alive Dr why should anyone
want to kill my Has not anyone only the

541
01:15:28.98 --> 01:15:33.77
monster he helped to create of those killed
for responsible for giving it life you

542
01:15:33.78 --> 01:15:37.91
doctor are the fifth and last it's absurd
Captain How could you mention those other

543
01:15:37.92 --> 01:15:42.83
two by providing your father and your
husband's corpse I don't have to tell you how

544
01:15:42.84 --> 01:15:47.80
they were used. How else are we to know
what you are talking about those jars in

545
01:15:47.81 --> 01:15:52.95
the laboratory won't be difficult to prove
they contain human organs not and no

546
01:15:52.96 --> 01:15:57.51
doctor you never considered the creature
might not appreciate your America that's

547
01:15:57.52 --> 01:16:01.90
why they killed the bear and three other
men that's why you must kill you why

548
01:16:01.91 --> 01:16:07.43
didn't you killed my father because your
husband was in the laboratory and. This is

549
01:16:07.44 --> 01:16:11.96
the most extraordinary fable I've ever
heard you really disappoint me captain or

550
01:16:11.97 --> 01:16:16.51
rather kill the Baron as for those other
two pyramids of integrity anyone could

551
01:16:16.52 --> 01:16:21.22
have had sufficient reason to kill that
perhaps it's your incompetence this led

552
01:16:21.23 --> 01:16:24.40
your imagination a raw I suggest you take

553
01:16:24.41 --> 01:16:30.98
a very well I warrant you remember
lies can keep you alive Dr but I can

554
01:16:32.09 --> 01:16:32.81
you know concern is

555
01:16:32.82 --> 01:16:37.47

Because the town the power that
felt I must kill it it's why.
